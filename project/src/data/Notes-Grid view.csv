The patient conveyed concerns about parents' potential separation and the anxiety the patience experiences in relation to the patient's academic responsibilities. The conversation centered on enhancing family communication, navigating recent familial changes and stressors, and developing strategies to manage the patient anxiety, particularly in the context of schoolwork.


Objective
The patient arrived on time for the patient appointment, accompanied by a family member, and presented self in a well-groomed and appropriate manner. Observationally, the patient exhibited signs of sadness and moderate anxiety; appeared worried, shy, and sensitive. The patient's mental state examination revealed the patient was oriented to person, place, time, and situation, with average intellectual and language functioning. The patient demonstrated strong memory capabilities, a good capacity for reflection and insight, some ability for self-observation, and sound judgment.

Assessment
The diagnostic impression remains consistent with an anxiety disorder. The patient reported no suicidal ideation, and thus current level of risk to self is deemed negligible. Throughout the session, the patient engaged with the therapeutic process, utilizing supportive techniques and focusing on the functioning in the here-and-now. The patient responded positively to the session, expressing relief at being heard and supported, and showed openness to the therapeutic services offered to alleviate life stressors.


Plan
The therapeutic strategy will continue to incorporate supportive techniques, with a sustained emphasis on enhancing the patient's problem-solving skills and coping mechanisms. A follow-up session is scheduled to assess overall progress. We will provide services to help mitigate worries and stress, including grounding techniques such as ""Dropping Anchor"" and belly breathing to aid in self-regulation.

1/27/2025 2:00pm,Elda 26FS,BH Consultation ,"Behavior
During the in-person session, the patient presented herself in a well-groomed and appropriate manner. Her affective and emotional state was mainly characterized by unhappiness and withdrawal. She engaged in discussions surrounding her recent transition to motherhood, the challenges of adjusting to new demands in her life, feelings of isolation and loneliness, parenting concerns, and coping with the aftermath of a past divorce. Her mental state was marked by appropriate orientation in terms of person, place, time, and situation, and she exhibited a good capacity for reflection and insight. However, there were dissociative features noted, which appeared to stem from an undisclosed traumatic experience.
Intervention
The therapeutic interventions implemented during the session were focused on developing and maintaining a strong therapeutic alliance to facilitate ongoing therapeutic work. Empathy and emotional support were provided throughout the session, along with attuned listening to the patient's immediate emotional experiences. These interventions aimed to help the patient feel understood and supported as she navigated her current emotional distress and life adjustments.
Response
The patient responded positively to the interventions, demonstrating engagement in the therapeutic process and a willingness to explore her emotional state and the challenges she is facing. Her capacity for insight and self-reflection was evident throughout the session. Despite the difficulties she is experiencing, the patient denied any suicidal ideation or intention, and no imminent risk to herself was identified. Her current level of risk to self (or other) is estimated to be negligible.
Plan
Moving forward, the plan is to continue fostering trust in the therapeutic setting and within interpersonal relationships. The patient will be supported in developing coping strategies to manage her adjustment disorder and the emotional distress associated with it. She has been provided with contact information and will follow up at a later date to schedule further therapy sessions if she wishes to continue her therapeutic journey.

The patient presented with significant distress, largely stemming from a series of overwhelming life events over the past few months. These events include the recent loss of their best friend to cancer, leaving a toxic relationship of 2.5 years a year ago, couch surfing due to mounting financial debt, and receiving a recent ADHD diagnosis a year ago. Despite these challenges, the patient appeared well-dressed and groomed during the session.

Presentation:
Throughout the session, the patient exhibited signs of cognitive fusion with anxiety. They provided numerous reasons and frequently shifted focus to various aspects of their life, all of which seemed to contribute to heightened distress. This constant mental shift made it difficult for the patient to focus on one particular issue at a time.

Therapeutic Intervention:
In response, we worked together to identify and map out the patient’s subsurface thinking patterns in an effort to increase their awareness of these automatic cognitive processes. By clarifying these thought patterns, the goal was to empower the patient to recognize and eventually regulate them. Additionally, grounding exercises were employed during the session, which helped reduce the patient's symptoms of anxiety and foster a greater sense of control over their behaviors through a present-focused mindshift.

The patient also shared insights into his emotional struggle, which included signs of bargaining, as he reflected on a near decision to return to Guatemala to reconcile with his ex-wife and spoke about granting her forgiveness in hopes of staying together. This bargaining behavior aligned with his emotional processing, as he was still grappling with the loss. In our session, we introduced the Kübler-Ross stages of grief to help normalize his emotional experience, tying the concept to his core values of commitment and integrity in relationships.

During the conversation, the patient frequently used language that suggested denial of her current emotional state, with statements such as ""I should not be feeling this way,"" ""I used to be stronger in the past,"" and ""This is not me."" These phrases appeared to serve as maladaptive coping mechanisms, rejecting the pain and distress she was experiencing. This was addressed during the session, and creative hopelessness techniques were employed to highlight the futility of rejecting negative emotions, emphasizing that such emotions tend to intensify when suppressed.

Grounding and reflective techniques were used to help the patient explore what it would look like to have a supportive partner during this time, and how she can offer this support to herself. Additionally, strategies were discussed around setting smaller, more manageable goals and being open to her current emotional experience. These approaches were well-received, and the patient demonstrated a positive response.

 The patient presented with an eager yet somewhat cautious affect, expressing a strong desire to break free from traumatic generational dynamics. She reported experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression without any specific onset, except for the pressures of being a single parent to her three children. The patient described a history of sexual and physical abuse from her family beginning in 1st grade, the death of her father who made her feel unworthy of love, and being placed in foster care at a young age. She also noted the emotional toll of raising three children, often feeling impulsive in her parenting reactions due to heightened emotions. Additionally, the patient shared the experience of leaving a physically abusive relationship of 13 years two years ago. She feels that she puts up walls and appears emotionally cold in relationships, which she attributes to past trauma, suggesting an avoidant attachment style. The patient expressed eagerness and motivation to begin healing, seeking guidance on the first steps she should take. 
Objective 
The patient demonstrated an eager and motivated demeanor. Her affect was somewhat cautious but engaged. There were no signs of acute distress during the session, and she appeared receptive to the discussion. The patient’s history of trauma and the impact on her emotional regulation were discussed, and she seemed to understand the concepts of attachment styles and the role of past experiences in shaping her emotional responses. Grounding techniques were utilized, which helped the patient regulate her fear regarding change. 
Assessment 
The patient is experiencing significant emotional distress, likely stemming from unresolved trauma, which has contributed to difficulties in parenting, relationship building, and emotional regulation. Her presentation suggests an avoidant attachment style, which aligns with her tendency to isolate and put up walls in relationships. The patient's impulsive emotional reactions, particularly in the context of parenting, point to difficulties in managing heightened emotions, possibly linked to her trauma history. Her eagerness to turn a new leaf and seek help is a positive sign of motivation for change. There is a need for continued therapeutic intervention to address trauma and improve emotional regulation skills.
 Plan
 1. Schedule the patient with the counseling team for follow-up therapy to address her trauma history, attachment style, and emotional regulation issues. 2. Encourage the patient to continue exploring her trauma with a licensed counselor to further process past experiences and develop healthier coping mechanisms. 3.

Upon speaking with the patient, he did not make eye contact and only answered simple yes or no questions. He expressed feeling sad, angry, lonely, and fearful of returning to school, although when attempting to inquire more about these feelings, the patient remained silent. Altogether, given the patient's presentation and his withdrawn manner, both behavioral health consultants see the behavior as either a developmental delay, severe fusing with thoughts and experiences, or an unknown medical diagnosis. Any further attempt to engage the patient was unsuccessful even after he stated ""[he] required additional help"", due to the patient's inability to disclose further information. Upon speaking to the patient's guardian, she mentioned the patient is physically aggressive towards her, citing previous occurrences where he threatened her with a knife and once threw a blender at her head, causing her blurry vision. The behavior, the guardian states, started upon the patient finding out about the guardian's previous ongoing pregnancy. The guardian fears receiving the same treatment during her present pregnancy. On one occasion, the guardian called the cops, prompting the patient to be detained for 24 hours, although the guardian states she does not want to resort to notifying law enforcement at this moment. Given the severe nature of the threats and the ambiguous nature of the patient's mental status, the guardian will return with the patient to the clinic to be evaluated by a medical professional.

During the session, the patient's PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were reassessed, revealing increased scores of 19 and 15, respectively. She reported a distressed affect, which prompted her request for a follow-up appointment. This request was granted partly due to her elevated scores and emotional state. The patient explained that she had missed her previous behavioral health appointment because she was overwhelmed by starting a new job and wanted to feel settled before addressing her mental health needs.
In the session, she voiced her distress over recent political changes perceived to target Hispanic communities, which added to her anxiety. Additionally, she shared concerns about her relationship with her 15-year-old daughter, describing it as ""too rebellious."" She recounted using authoritarian methods, such as confiscating her daughter's phone for extended periods and constantly worrying about her daughter's whereabouts. This approach had led to a significant increase in her anxiety levels. Her worries were compounded by fears that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) might detain her at work, despite her legal status, further escalating her anxiety and distress.
During the consultation, the focus shifted to parenting styles, emphasizing the advantages of adopting an authoritative rather than an authoritarian approach. The discussion also covered the importance of trust in relationships, the concept of locus of control—particularly regarding elements beyond personal influence, such as government policies—and the value of maintaining a present-moment mindset. Emphasis was placed on managing one's actions within relationships and personal life to mitigate stress and anxiety.

An MDQ was administered, which was negative for a mood disorder, indicated by a ""No"" response to question 2 and a ""no problem"" on question 3. Her GAD-7 score was 4, and her PHQ-9 score was 6.

The patient stated having racing thoughts, after waking up at 3 a.m., often about the lack of availability of work and a recent car accident he was involved in which he received no compensation for damages. These experiences, combined with some feelings of inadequacy surrounding his inability to ""do things correctly"" around his family, have led to elevated anxiety and difficulty staying asleep. During our session, we spoke about breathing exercises that may help with his recurring anxiety, as well as tips for a better night's sleep.

Background
Summary of the Initial Presenting Difficulties: The patient sought Behavioral Health assistance due to experiencing challenges in the relationship and pregnancy. Additionally, the patient was informed by provider that unborn baby had been diagnosed with Down Syndrome, a condition the patient was previously unfamiliar with. The patient reported feeling depressed about current life circumstances.


Treatment Summary
Overview of the Treatment Process: The Behavioral Health Consultant developed two treatment plans for the patient. The first addressed the recent changes in the patient's life concerning with unborn child's diagnosis. The consultant provided education about the diagnosis and connected the patient with SISKIN, an organization offering programs for children with disabilities. The second plan focused on helping connect with organizations and develop a safety plan to leave husband post-birth. During this process, the consultant explored the patient's values in relationships and discussed the potential impact on the patient's other children. Gains and Progress Made: The patient expressed a better understanding and acceptance of unborn child's diagnosis, although the patient initially felt overwhelmed by the prospect of following up with SISKIN due to the numerous prenatal appointments. The patient indicated a willingness to reach out to SISKIN once baby was born and required support. After the birth, the patient observed significant positive changes in the relationship with husband. The patient's husband began taking the children to school and managing household responsibilities, which allowed to focus on the hospital visits and bonding with the baby. The patient noted improved communication and teamwork with husband, leading the patient to decide to remain in the relationship without needing further assistance or a safety plan. Goals and Objectives Attained: The patient has achieved goals and objectives.


Recommendations
The following recommendations were made: The patient reported feeling better and capable of managing emotions, though the patient occasionally felt sad about not having baby at home. The patient recognized that this separation was necessary for the baby's wellbeing. The patient is aware of the option to return to the clinic if needed and is knowledgeable about available resources.",12/11/2024,"Philip Sutherland, MD",,,

Data
During the in-person session, the patient presented with a diagnostic impression consistent with experiences of school bullying, as well as feelings of sadness and nervousness stemming from these incidents. The patient reported feeling somewhat improved and better overall, yet maintained a shy demeanor throughout the session. Our discussion primarily revolved around strategies to expand the patient's social network at school, structuring daily activities, planning for the future, and establishing a protocol for seeking help from adult authorities when faced with bullying.

Despite arriving very late for the appointment, the patient was appropriately dressed and exhibited a generally positive and content emotional state. The patient was observed to be happy, albeit shy, soft-spoken, and at times embarrassed, yet the patient managed to smile during the session.


Assessment
The patient did not report any suicidal ideation; therefore, current level of risk to self is deemed negligible. The therapeutic interventions employed in the session included supportive techniques to bolster self-esteem, encouragement of self-expression, and a focus on enhancing her problem-solving and coping skills. Attuned listening was provided to address immediate emotional experiences. We also set treatment and session goals and reviewed progress with previously assigned homework. The patient response to these interventions was positive, expressed feelings of relief and an increased sense of wellbeing. The patient also showed openness to the services offered to help minimize the stressors in life.

Plan
The treatment plan moving forward will include continued WHO follow-up sessions with the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC). A follow-up session is scheduled in two weeks to assess the patient's emotional state, inquire whether the bullying has persisted, and determine if the patient has been successful in achieving goals. Additionally, there will be a follow-up with the patient's mother to discuss the possibility of enrolling the patient in an after-school program for the upcoming year.",1/25/2025," Tiffany Good, MD",,,

Data



The patient presented with challenges related to adjusting to life in the United States, compounded by recent grief and potential past childhood trauma. The patient expressed sadness over the recent loss of a significant family friend, lamenting the inability to say a final goodbye. Additionally, the patient is experiencing difficulty adapting to the new traditions, language, and customs of the current environment compared to those of the patient's home country. The patient also alluded to an unresolved issue involving father, though the patient was not forthcoming with details. The patient primary motivation for seeking therapy was to manage recent struggles healthily and to gain insight into emotional experiences.



During the treatment process, the patient was referred to a therapist at Clinica Medicos Renuevo to address recent struggles. Both the patient and mother were informed about the therapeutic process and upcoming appointments. Resources were offered by the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) to support the patient and the family. However, the patient did not attend the scheduled session. No progress was noted, and the goals and objectives of the treatment remained unattained.



Assessment



The patient's struggles appear to be multifaceted, involving cultural adjustment, grief, and potential unresolved childhood trauma. The patient's emotional state, as reported, includes feelings of sadness and confusion regarding recent experiences. The observed lack of attendance at the session suggests possible barriers such as scheduling conflicts or transportation issues, which the patient mentioned as reasons for not continuing with the services at this time. There are no immediate concerns regarding risk to self or others based on the available information.



Plan



The BHC followed up with the patient via phone to discuss the patient's needs and offer services, allowing the patient to reschedule the appointment. The patient expressed that the patient does not currently require services, citing scheduling and transportation challenges as primary obstacles. The patient indicated a willingness to return for support when necessary. Moving forward, the plan involves maintaining open communication with the patient to accommodate availability and ensure that the patient feels supported when the patient decides to seek assistance again.

Data
Patient presented with symptoms of depression stemming from an abusive relationship, which the patient recently exited. The patient reported enduring physical and emotional abuse from ex-husband over approximately 10-12 years. The patient expressed significant struggles related to this recent separation, compounded by responsibilities of caring for children and seeking legal assistance. During the session, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) offered community resources, including access to food assistance, rental aid, and the Family Justice Center, where the patient could seek help in obtaining a restraining order against ex-husband. Despite these efforts, the patient did not respond to follow-up calls from the BHC, who attempted to contact her three times without success.

Assessment
The patient's ongoing struggles with depression and trauma are directly linked to prolonged abusive relationship and recent separation. The patient inability to respond to follow-up calls suggests potential barriers to accessing support, whether due to logistical challenges, emotional overwhelm, or other factors. The immediate goal is to ensure safety, given the patient's ex-husband's awareness of the new location. The patient is advised to connect with a therapist to address the trauma experienced during the marriage.

Plan
The treatment plan focuses on ensuring the patient's safety and facilitating the patient connection to necessary therapeutic and community resources. The BHC will left one final call for the patient, reinforcing the patient awareness of available services at Clinia Medicos should the patient require further assistance. Continued efforts will be made to engage in therapy to process traumatic experiences and develop coping strategies. Additionally, the patient will be encouraged to utilize community resources for practical support, such as food and housing assistance, to alleviate some of immediate stressors.

The patient described feeling generally content, calm, and reflective, with some improvements noted. However, the patient also expressed worries, particularly in the context of managing and coping with anger and distress within the family. The patient is working on exploring and improving communication with family members, adapting to recent changes in family life, and handling the demands of daily life. These discussions are framed within the context of the patient past experiences with an abusive relationship, which aligns with the patient's diagnostic impression of a depressive disorder.

Observationally, the patient arrived punctually, was appropriately dressed, and presented with a generally positive demeanor. The patient's affective and emotional state was consistent with self-report, showing signs of contentment and improvement, yet underscored by a sense of worry.


Assessment
The patient currently does not report any suicidal ideation, and thus, her estimated level of risk to herself is considered negligible. Throughout the session, therapeutic interventions were employed, including supportive techniques, a focus on present functioning, empathetic responses, and attuned listening to the immediate emotional experiences. The patient response to these interventions was positive; the patient conveyed feelings of relief and an increased sense of wellbeing. The patient also demonstrated an openness to the services offered, aimed at minimizing life stressors.



Plan
Moving forward, the plan is to continue therapeutic sessions with the patient, maintaining a focus on the emotional support and safety. The treatment plan will include the development and implementation of a safety plan regarding ex-husband to ensure he does not come into close proximity, thereby enhancing sense of security and wellbeing.

Data
During the in-person session, the patient presented with a diagnostic impression consistent with major depressive disorder, an anxiety disorder, an adjustment disorder, and suicidal thoughts/attempt. The patient reported feeling sad, distressed, mildly anxious, worried, and stressed, with sensations of crying, feeling down, and disappointment. The patient inability to sleep was also noted. The session focused on coping with frustrations, conflict with family member, a recent separation from partner, and the betrayal of ex-boyfriend cheating with the patient's sister. We also discussed difficulties with managing anger and distress within family, transitioning to adulthood and adult responsibilities, the strain of mid-life transitions, coping with recent changes in family life, and dealing with the news of an unexpected pregnancy and considering abortion options.

Upon observation, the patient appeared on time for the appointment, was appropriately dressed, and presented with an affective and emotional state that was mainly unhappy, sad, distressed, moderately depressed, withdrawn, moderately anxious, angry, fearful, fragile, shy, stressed, resentful, sensitive, emotionally hurt, worried, frustrated, embarrassed, and crying. Notably, the patient also expressed feelings of disappointment, anger, and suicidal ideation.

The therapeutic interventions utilized during the session included supportive techniques, fostering self-expression, focusing on here-and-now functioning, coping with current life difficulties, providing empathy and emotional support, and attuned listening to immediate emotional experiences. The patient's response to these interventions was indicative of high level of distress and the need for ongoing support and crisis management.

Assessment
The patient's reported suicidal ideation, intention, and risk factors, coupled with her lack of protective factors, indicate a high and significant level of imminent risk to self. The emotional and psychological turmoil the patient is experiencing due to relational issues, recent separation, and unexpected pregnancy contribute to heightened risk status. Patient mentioned not wanting to hurt mother is the motivation to not hurt self. Patient mentioned only having suicidal ideation with no attempt as on now. 

Plan
Given the patient's high level of risk to self, the patient has been referred to Clinica Renuevo to begin sessions with a therapist specialized in managing such crises. Behavioral Health Consultation (BHC) will continue WHO sessions to assist the patient in managing the new changes in life, including the recent betrayal by ex-partner with her sister and the news of unexpected pregnancy.

The patient spoke on recent marital issues and her emotionally mature way of confronting relational conflicts, which she feels her husband does not share. She mentions a dynamic in which she needs to have an agitated emotional response (crying) for her husband to partake in whatever activity she proposes so that her husband engages without resentment.

The mother and sister spoke about their anxieties regarding the youngest, who has hydrocephaly, amongst other health concerns, which they both stated caused uncertainty and stress in the family. The traumatic incident involved an individual under the influence almost running over the youngest some time ago, causing an altercation between the man and the father, causing the individual to point a firearm at the father's head. The patient cites this traumatic event as the main reason for her insomnia and unwanted thoughts. The patient's mother has constant anxiety about losing her child at any time yet chooses to remain hopeful.

During the behavioral health consultation, the patient disclosed that his onset of Ed was during his first sexual experience at 17, causing shame, performance anxiety, and a lack of self-confidence. He disclosed having fear and avoidance of sex for the next 5 years and not having a partner during that time. He most recently began having sexual intercourse, having five partners since the time of the present visit, with one of them cheating on him, which he thinks was in part due to his sexual impotence. During the present visit, we reflected on the shame he feels every time he has sex and how it may feed his insecurities regarding sex, as well as the importance of building sexual tension and foreplay. We also discussed the importance of using sexual protection and exploring things like using condoms or trying novel sexual experiences with his supportive partner to build confidence and minimize shame over time. The patient proved eager to try these approaches and to frameshift sex as an experience filled with trial and error that, with more practice and less shame, can turn into a fun bonding experience between supportive partners. The team will follow up with the patient in two weeks to assess progress. 

Consult with TG: The physician discussed the potential connection between sudden onset erectile dysfunction (ED) and underlying vascular conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

Key Points:
Vascular Disease: In men under 40, ED can sometimes be an early sign of vascular problems, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which can affect blood flow to the penis.

Sudden Onset: A sudden appearance of ED might suggest an underlying issue, such as vascular disease, which could be present even in younger, otherwise healthy individuals.

Psychological Factors: While physical causes like vascular disease are significant, psychological factors like stress or anxiety can also contribute to ED. Resources like Come as You Are by Emily Nagoski were mentioned to address the psychological aspects of ED and encourage a holistic approach to treatment.

Data
The patient presented self with high scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9, indicating significant symptoms of anxiety. In response to the patient's provider's recommendation, the patient expressed openness to participating in a Warm Hand Off  (WHO) session and engaging with behavioral health services. However, there have been challenges in establishing contact for the WHO appointment. The patient reported confusion regarding the scheduled time, which resulted in the appointment not taking place. Despite efforts to reach the patient via phone calls to reschedule, the patient has not responded to these attempts.



Assessment
There has been no observable progress or gains in addressing the patient's initial presenting difficulties, primarily due to communication barriers and scheduling conflicts. The unmet goals and objectives remain a significant concern, as the lack of engagement with the scheduled WHO session has stalled potential advancements in the patient's treatment. It is crucial to acknowledge that no risks to self or others have been identified during this period.



Plan
To facilitate the patient's access to needed services, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) will make one additional attempt to contact her via phone call. A final text message will also be sent, extending an invitation for the patient to return to the clinic if the patient is in need of services. These efforts aim to re-establish communication and encourage the patient participation in the recommended wellness and health optimization activities.

4/9/2025 8:14am,Ruth Raymundo 12 FS,BH Consultation ,"Data
During the in-person session, the patient presented with a complex array of psychological challenges, including a depressive disorder, an anxiety disorder, and behavioral challenges, all compounded by the patient struggle with suicidal ideations. The patient reported feeling a range of difficult emotions such as sadness, but mother shared the patient also struggles with frustration, compulsiveness, and anger, particularly in relation to her family environment. The patient expressed difficulties with family dynamics, including conflicts, communication issues, and a lack of personal space, which seemed to exacerbate feelings of frustration, anger, and compulsiveness.

Upon observation, the patient arrived on time, dressed casually, and exhibited a range of affective and emotional states. The patient appeared sad, mildly depressed, embarrassed, uncomfortable, fragile, stressed, sensitive, and frustrated. The patient's manner of speaking was soft and slow, and was noted to be crying at times. Additionally, the patient presented as disappointed, suicidal, guilty, introverted, and quiet.

Interventions during the session included supportive techniques aimed at fostering self-expression and focusing on functioning in the present moment. There was an emphasis on improving problem-solving and coping skills, as well as impulse control and anger management. Empathy and emotional support were provided throughout the session. The patient was also given the 988 crisis number for additional support. The patient response to the interventions was characterized by reflective silence, and although initially hesitant, the patient expressed a willingness to try further counseling services.

Assessment
Considering the patient's reported suicidal ideation, intentions, and the balance of risk and protective factors, the patient current level of imminent risk to herself appears low. Her response to the therapeutic interventions, including her reflective silence and initial reluctance to continue with WHO sessions or counseling services, suggests a cautious openness to further treatment. The provision of the 988 crisis number was an important step in ensuring she has immediate access to help if needed.

Plan
Moving forward, the patient has agreed to explore counseling options at the patient's school. The patient mother will assist in this process by inquiring about available school counseling services. Should school-based counseling not be an option, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) will facilitate a connection with a child counselor in the community. The plan emphasizes the importance of continued therapeutic support to address the patient's mental health needs and to provide the patient with strategies to manage the patient emotions and family-related challenges.",4/9/2025,John Pound FNP-BC ,,,

Patient presented with significant grief following the loss of two family members. This grief manifested in several ways: experienced difficulty sleeping due to persistent negative thoughts, became increasingly anti-social, and showed a lack of motivation for self-care. These symptoms significantly impacted the patient's daily functioning. During the initial assessment, patient reported that these challenges were directly related to the patient's recent bereavement.



In terms of treatment, the patient was initially referred to Clinica Medicos Renuevo due to elevated GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores, indicating heightened anxiety and depressive symptoms. Since beginning therapy, patient has attended multiple sessions with a licensed therapist. Reported improvements in emotional state and noted the effectiveness of coping strategies introduced by therapist. Patient expressed that these tools have been beneficial in managing symptoms.



Assessment



The patient's initial presenting difficulties centered around intense grief and associated symptoms such as insomnia, social withdrawal, and diminished motivation for self-care. These issues were observed to stem from the recent loss of close family members. However, through therapeutic intervention, patient has shown significant progress. Reported a decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, attributing this improvement to the therapeutic tools and techniques learned during sessions.



The patient's ability to articulate feelings and the positive changes they've experienced suggests a successful engagement with the therapeutic process. Also demonstrated an increased capacity to manage grief in a healthier manner. As of now, patient does not perceive a need for ongoing behavioral health (BH) services, indicating a substantial reduction in distress levels.



Plan



The patient has expressed confidence in ability to manage grief without further immediate support from behavioral health services. The patient has acknowledged the tools and strategies provided by therapy as instrumental in recovery process. It has been recommended that patient remains aware of mental health status and is open to seeking services again if needed. The plan moving forward includes patient maintaining the current coping strategies and monitoring emotional well-being.

The patient reported feeling sad, experiencing sensations of crying, poor appetite, guilt, sleeping excessively, and a lack of motivation for self-care, such as showering or brushing teeth. The patient also expressed feelings of frustration, desperation, and compulsion. During session BHC explored the patient's stressful experiences, low self-esteem, poor confidence, and efforts toward self-empathy and mindfulness.

There were signs of disorientation regarding the patient's person and identity, and intellectual functioning seemed somewhat impaired.


Assessment
Considering the patient's reported and observed emotional state, along with homicidal ideation, intention, risk, and protective factors, the patient's current level of imminent risk to self  appears moderate and is of some concern. The therapeutic interventions employed in the session included supportive techniques, focusing on the patient's functioning in the here-and-now, coping with current life difficulties, providing empathy and emotional support, and attuned listening to the patient's immediate emotional experiences. A safety plan was created, and suicide/crisis line information (988) was provided. The patient showed openness to the services offered to minimize life stressors.


Plan
A safety plan was established with the patient to address suicidal ideations, detailing where to go, who to call, and the importance of not being alone.

Background
The patient initially presented with symptoms of depression accompanied by suicidal ideations, further compounded by the unexpected news of pregnancy. The patient expressed significant distress over this development, as the patient had not planned to become pregnant in the near future. During the initial consultation, the patient sought information and resources regarding abortion or adoption options. Additionally, the patient was grappling with feelings of betrayal stemming from recent breakup with an ex-boyfriend and perceived betrayal by the patient's sister.

Treatment Summary
Throughout the treatment process, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) focused on educating the patient about depression, aiming to help the patient understand condition better. The BHC encouraged the patient to express and process the myriad of emotions the patient was experiencing. The therapeutic approach centered on continuing sessions to equip with tools and knowledge necessary for healing from recent breakup and exploring potential solutions regarding unexpected pregnancy.

Data
The patient presented with significant anxiety, manifesting as chest pain and crying spells. The patient's mother reported that these symptoms had been troubling the patient for approximately two years. During the session, the patient expressed feelings of overwhelming anxiety, which were observed as described physical sensations of tightness and shortness of breath. The patient also reported episodes of unexplained crying.
Efforts were made to provide the patient and the patient's mother with self-regulation tools aimed at managing symptoms, particularly during episodes of chest pain. However, despite these efforts, there was no observed progress in the patient's ability to manage symptoms independently. The inability to connect with the patient's family further hindered the provision of ongoing support, as the referral to the Volunteer Behavioral Health Center could not be completed due to disconnected contact numbers.

Assessment
The patient's ongoing anxiety appears to be significantly impacting daily functioning, particularly in relation to school and social environments. The lack of progress in symptom management suggests a need for a more structured intervention, possibly involving a specialist in pediatric anxiety. The patient's emotional state, characterized by frequent crying spells and physical manifestations of anxiety, indicates a high level of distress that requires immediate attention. The inability to reach family for further support underscores the urgency of finding alternative means to ensure continuity of care.

Plan
Given the current situation, it is recommended that the patient and family are encouraged to seek services from another behavioral health provider who can offer more consistent support. Behavioral Health Consultant has tried to connect with the patient's mother to provide services but has no been able to connect with family due to numbers are disconnected.

Data
The patient initially presented with symptoms of mild to moderate depression, primarily attributed to experiences of bullying at school. The patient reported feelings of sadness and a lack of motivation to attend school. During the treatment process, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) continued follow-up sessions with both the patient and  mother. The patient's parents took proactive steps by arranging a meeting with the school to address concerns regarding the patient's safety and support. The patient was also equipped with self-regulation tools, such as belly breathing and the ""dropping anchor"" technique, to manage anxiety related to school attendance. Additionally, the patient received guidance on communication strategies to facilitate making new friendships, aligning with the patient's expressed goal of expanding social network.



After the intervention at school, notable progress was observed. Both the patient and mother reported positive changes. The patient appeared happier and less burdened by the patient's school-related struggles. The patient noted a decrease or cessation in incidents of bullying by classmates. Furthermore, the patient successfully expanded the patient's social circle, providing the patient's with opportunities to connect with more peers.

Assessment
The patient demonstrated significant improvement in the patient's emotional state and overall well-being following the collaborative efforts of the patient's family and the school. The reduction in bullying incidents and the patient's ability to form new friendships contributed to enhanced mood and decreased depressive symptoms. The patient's mother corroborated these observations, noting daughter's improved demeanor and reduced school-related challenges. Despite missing a face-to-face follow-up session, the patient's mother indicated that the patient was currently feeling and performing better.

Plan
To sustain and build upon the progress achieved, it is recommended that the patient and mother remain vigilant and consider returning to the clinic should the need for services arise in the future. Continued support and monitoring will be crucial to maintaining the patient's mental health improvements and addressing any potential setbacks promptly. The patient's successful application of self-regulation tools and communication strategies should be reinforced, encouraging the patient to continue utilizing these techniques to navigate future challenges.

During the in-person session, the patient presented with a range of emotional and affective states, expressing feelings of unhappiness, sadness, worry, and emotional sensitivity. The patient reported experiencing crying spells, nervousness, poor appetite, feelings of being down, sleep disturbances, a lack of motivation, and depression. The therapeutic conversation centered on the patient's struggles with relational frustrations, boundary issues in interpersonal relationships, conflicts with the patient spouse/partner, and coping with recent changes in family and couple dynamics. Additionally, the patient is grappling with the news of an unexpected pregnancy, managing daily life, self-care challenges, and exploring financial, food, and clothing resources due to unemployment.

Observationally, the patient appeared on time, dressed formally, and exhibited signs of being mainly unhappy, sad, moderately depressed, fragile, shy, nervous, stressed, sensitive, emotionally hurt, worried, embarrassed, and tearful. There was also a noted disappointment, quiet demeanor, and suspicion of sexual abuse from partner.


Assessment
The patient is not currently expressing suicidal ideation, indicating a negligible risk to self at this time. The therapeutic interventions employed in the session included supportive techniques, fostering self-expression, focusing on present functioning, coping with current life difficulties, improving problem-solving and coping strategies, providing empathy and emotional support, attuned listening, addressing dysfunctional thoughts, and providing information on the Family Justice Center. The patient response to these interventions was positive, as the patient expressed feelings of relief, well-being, and an openness to the services offered to alleviate her life stressors.

Data



Patient presented initially for services due to experiencing symptoms consistent with post-partum depression. Despite efforts to engage the patient in treatment, the patient has not been responsive to attempts to schedule appointments. The Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) made numerous attempts to contact via phone to arrange a Warm Hand Off (WHO) appointment but was unsuccessful. As a result, there have been no gains or progress made in treatment. The patient goals and objectives remain unattained due to this lack of communication and engagement.



Assessment



The patient's lack of response to outreach efforts suggests a potential disengagement from the therapeutic process. This may be indicative of ongoing struggles with post-partum depression symptoms, which could be affecting motivation or ability to participate in scheduled sessions. The absence of observable emotional states or reported feelings during these interactions further complicates the understanding of current mental health status. There is no evidence to suggest an immediate risk to self or others based on the available data.



Plan



The BHC will attempt one final phone call to reach the patient, emphasizing the availability of services should decide to return to the clinic. A voicemail was left, indicating that the patient may return to the clinic when ready to engage with services. If contact is re-established, a comprehensive reassessment of the patient's mental health status and current needs will be necessary to adjust treatment goals and objectives accordingly.

Data



The patient, a female, presented with ongoing struggles with depression and suicidal ideations. Historically, the patient had been engaged with a licensed therapist, Karla, at Clinica Medicos Renuevo and was on medication to manage symptoms. Recently, due to persistent suicidal ideations and depression, the patient was referred by Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) to another licensed therapist, Jarett, at Clinica Renuevo. The BHC is actively working to connect the patient with housing assistance, which is a significant concern impacting overall well-being. During the session with Jarett, the patient attended and reported some relief in symptoms, indicating progress. The patient has expressed agreement to continue sessions with Jarett at Clinica Medicos Renuevo and to persist with medication regimen.



Assessment



The patient's current challenges primarily revolve around depression and suicidal ideations. Despite previous interventions, these issues persist, highlighting a need for continued therapeutic engagement and possibly adjustments in treatment plan. The patient willingness to engage with therapy and adhere to medication suggests a commitment to mental health journey. The biopsychosocial factors contributing to the patient's condition include unstable housing situation, which is a source of stress and may exacerbate depressive symptoms. The patient's reported improvement during session with Jarett is a positive sign, suggesting that ongoing therapy could be beneficial. However, the persistence of suicidal ideations indicates a need for close monitoring and possibly enhanced support structures.



Plan



Moving forward, the plan includes several key components aimed at supporting the patient's mental health and overall stability. The BHC will continue efforts to assist the patient in securing housing assistance, recognizing the critical role stable housing plays in the patient's recovery. The patient has agreed to maintain therapeutic relationship with Jarett at Clinica Medicos Renuevo, which is crucial for ongoing support. Additionally, adherence to medication regimen will be emphasized to ensure continuity in managing symptoms.

During the in-person session, the patient presented with symptoms consistent with a diagnostic impression of generalized anxiety disorder. The patient reported feeling moderately anxious, which was reflected in the patient's demeanor as the patient appeared sad, fragile, and was observed crying. Despite introverted and quiet nature, the patient was punctual and dressed casually for the appointment. 

Throughout the session, various therapeutic interventions were employed. Supportive techniques were utilized to create a safe and empathetic environment for the patient to express concerns. The focus was placed on here-and-now functioning to help the patient stay grounded in the present moment. Additionally, behavioral health counseling (BHC) provided the patient with practical tools to manage anxiety symptoms. These included the ""Dropping Anchor"" technique and breathing exercises. Furthermore, the patient was educated on the importance of acknowledging uncomfortable emotions rather than avoiding them.

The patient's response to these interventions was observed and noted. The patient's participation in the exercises and engagement in discussing emotional experiences indicated a level of receptiveness to the therapeutic process.

Assessment
The patient did not report any suicidal ideation during the session. Consequently, the patient current level of risk to self appears negligible. The patient's emotional state, while indicative of anxiety, did not suggest an immediate danger to safety or well-being.

Plan
Moving forward, the plan is to continue supporting the patient with the therapeutic interventions that have been beneficial thus far. This includes reinforcing the use of ""Dropping Anchor"" and breathing exercises to manage anxiety when it arises. Additionally, there will be a concerted effort to assist the patient in recognizing and processing uncomfortable emotions as they occur.

Patient presented to the office following her initial appointment with Nurse John. She shared a difficult personal history that includes her alcoholic father being abusive before his death three years ago. She noted that her mother never left the father despite the abuse, and described her as emotionally unavailable throughout her childhood. She also reported a history of sexual abuse by her stepfather. The patient has moved frequently and immigrated to the U.S. at a young age, which disrupted her sense of stability.

She disclosed two prior suicide attempts during particularly overwhelming times—one three years ago involving cutting her wrists and another a month ago involving a hanging attempt. She described her daily routine as repetitive and unchanging: waking up, eating, and sleeping with no real variation or engagement in other activities. She expressed feeling unmotivated and stated that she doesn't have any goals at the moment.

The patient mentioned experiencing unsettling perceptual experiences, such as hearing voices when her mother isn’t around and seeing shadowy figures in her peripheral vision—especially eyes or a red, eerie face. These experiences seemed to cause her discomfort but were shared without panic or disorganization.

O: Objective
The patient was quiet and reserved during the session but engaged appropriately. Affect was flat but appropriate to the content shared. She showed insight into her challenges and communicated clearly despite the emotional weight of the topics. She appeared somewhat guarded at first but gradually opened up. By the end of the session, the patient appeared more at ease and even expressed a sense of relief after being heard and supported by the Behavioral Health (BH) team. She remained open to trying new things, and getting outside her comfort zone, like following up with the counseling team and learning more tools to handle her situation.

A: Assessment
Patient is a 14-year-old adolescent navigating a history of significant family trauma, instability, and emotional neglect. Her responses suggest she is carrying a great deal for her age, with limited tools or support systems to help her cope. Her experiences—both internal and external—appear to be overwhelming and may be contributing to feelings of hopelessness, isolation, and emotional exhaustion. The perceptual disturbances she described may be related to the stress and trauma she’s endured.

She appears to be in need of consistent emotional support, safety, and guidance to help her begin building a healthier internal narrative and future goals.

P: Plan

Provided support and helped normalize the complex emotions and reactions she is experiencing given her background.

Reinforced the BH office as a safe and judgment-free space she can return to whenever she needs support.

Referral initiated for counseling to help her start developing coping tools, explore her experiences more deeply, and build resilience over time.

Plan

The patient expressed gratitude for this assistance and noted an improvement in emotional state since the intervention. Moving forward, the plan involves the patient initiating contact with one or more of the recommended counselors to begin therapy. Continued monitoring of the patient's emotional well-being will be essential to ensure ongoing support and adjustment of the treatment plan as needed",5/5/2025,"Joy Ferro, DO",,,

A safety plan was collaboratively developed, and the 988-crisis number was shared with the patient 

for immediate support if needed. The patient mentioned that she would be prescribed medication to manage symptoms and expressed a desire to see a counselor. Assistance was offered by the BHC to find a counselor who accepts the patient's insurance.

The patient acknowledged having supportive networks at home, work, and the clinic, which is greatly appreciated. Currently, the patient expressed no need for further behavioral health (BH) resources, though the patient remains aware of the option to return to the clinic if necessary in the future.

Assessment

Data
During the in-person session, the patient presented with a complex array of symptoms consistent with depressive, anxiety, and adjustment disorders, compounded by significant life stressors. The patient reported feelings of sadness, distress, withdrawal, fragility, and being overwhelmed. The patient was engaged in discussing stressful experiences, coping with a recent serious medical diagnosis, and struggles with low self-esteem and poor confidence. Efforts to enhance mindfulness, adjust to new financial hardships, manage daily life, and navigate social resources were also explored. The patient expressed feeling overwhelmed by the confluence of recent life and financial changes.

Observationally, the patient arrived on time, dressed casually but appeared poorly groomed and unkempt. The patient emotional state was predominantly unhappy, withdrawn, and fragile, with signs of fear, fatigue, and overwhelm. The patient was also distracted by childcare responsibilities, and exhibited nervousness, stress, sensitivity, worry, frustration, and disappointment, which manifested in slow speech and occasional crying.

Interventions during the session included supportive techniques, encouragement of self-expression, focus on here-and-now functioning, and coping with current life difficulties. Problem-solving strategies were discussed, and the patient was provided with empathy, emotional support, and attuned listening to immediate emotional experiences. The patient responded to these interventions with openness and appeared receptive to the services offered to alleviate life stressors.


Assessment
The patient is not currently reporting any suicidal ideation; therefore, the patient's estimated level of risk to self is considered negligible. The therapeutic interventions provided during the session appeared to be effective in facilitating the patient's openness to support services and in providing a space to process emotions and experiences.


Plan
Moving forward, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) will continue to provide the patient with services aimed at managing and processing emotions during this challenging period in life. Supportive interventions will be sustained to foster the patient's coping abilities and emotional resilience. Additionally, social services support will be offered to help reduce life stressors that are contributing to the patient's mental and physical health concerns.

Data
The patient presented with significant anxiety and worry following the news of an unexpected pregnancy. The patient expressed concerns about family's reaction and whether the father of the baby would remain involved. The patient reported experiencing persistent, intrusive thoughts regarding these issues, which have been contributing to the distress. During the session, the patient appeared visibly anxious, with observed signs such as fidgeting and avoidance of eye contact, which align with the patient reported emotional state. The patient's biopsychosocial context includes potential familial pressures and the stress of managing a new, unplanned life event. The treatment plan initially focused on helping the patient's process these emotions and thoughts, alongside providing information about community support programs for mothers. However, the patient has not yet engaged with these resources.


Assessment
The patient's primary issue involves anxiety related to unexpected pregnancy and concerns about familial and paternal reactions. The patient reported intrusive thoughts are indicative of heightened anxiety levels, which are impacting the patient ability to cope effectively. The lack of engagement with recommended support programs and the inability to maintain consistent communication suggest potential barriers to accessing care, which may be due to logistical challenges or emotional overwhelm. There is no immediate risk to self or others reported in this session. The unmet goals and objectives highlight the need for ongoing support and possibly alternative strategies to facilitate engagement with mental health services.


Plan
To address the patient's current needs, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) will continue efforts to establish contact, recognizing the challenges posed by the patient's unresponsive contact number. It is crucial to explore alternative communication methods or support systems that might assist in reconnecting with the patient. If the patient returns to the clinic, the BHC will prioritize revisiting anxiety management strategies and reinforcing the importance of community support programs. Additionally, exploring potential barriers to the patient's engagement with these resources will be essential. The BHC will also assess the feasibility of involving family members or other support networks to provide with additional emotional backing.

Data
The patient presented with feelings of depression and challenges adapting to recent life changes, including an unexpected pregnancy. During the session, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) and the patient explored the patient's core values and priorities. The session focused on grounding techniques, such as ""Dropping Anchor,"" which aims to help stay present in the moment. Additionally, breathing exercises were introduced to provide mental respite from persistent thoughts. The patient and the BHC agreed to continue with WHO sessions to further explore goals and objectives.

Assessment
Throughout the session, the patient reported experiencing sensations of depression and difficulty coping with recent life changes. The patient expressed feeling overwhelmed by the unexpected pregnancy and the subsequent shifts in life plans.

Data
The patient presented with feelings of sadness stemming from recent significant life changes, particularly the patient's separation from husband, which was not voluntary. The patient expressed feeling isolated, is currently residing in the United States without substantial family or friend support. During the session, the patient reported experiencing these emotions acutely and described a sense of loneliness. The Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) observed signs of distress and noted the patient's emotional state as consistent with the patient reported feelings of sadness and isolation.


Assessment
The patient's current emotional state is primarily characterized by sadness and loneliness, which appear to be directly linked to recent separation and lack of social support. The patient's situation is further compounded by geographical isolation, as the patient is alone in the states. The BHC assessed that the patient's emotional distress is heightened by disconnection from support network. There were no indications of risk to self or others during this session. The patient's disconnected phone number suggests logistical challenges in maintaining contact, which may exacerbate feelings of isolation.


Plan
The BHC will continue to provide support by helping the patient access necessary resources, including rental assistance, food, and clothing. Efforts will be made to assist the patient in managing emotions and identifying personal goals to improve the situation. Although previous attempts to contact the patient via phone have been unsuccessful due to the number being disconnected, the BHC remains committed to reaching out and offering assistance if the patient returns to the clinic.

Data
The patient presented with sensations of mood swings and symptoms consistent with postpartum depression. The patient expressed feelings of frustration, irritability, and upset when situations did not align with expectations. These emotional fluctuations have impacted the patient's relationship with partner. The patient shared these experiences during sessions, highlighting the challenges the patient faces in managing emotions.



In the treatment process, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) conducted a WHO intake with the patient, providing education on postpartum depression and the mood changes women may experience after childbirth. The focus was placed on helping the patient identify and work towards personal goals, alongside introducing self-regulation tools such as ""dropping anchor,"" ""Cup Full,"" and ""deflate the balloon."" These strategies aimed to empower the patient in managing emotional state effectively.



Since the initial intake, the patient reported significant improvement in mood and overall emotional well-being. The patient noted feeling much better and expressed a desire to discontinue services at this time. The progress made indicates that the goals and objectives set during therapy have been attained, reflecting the capacity to manage mood swings and emotional responses more effectively.

Assessment
The patient has demonstrated considerable progress in managing postpartum depression and mood swings. The therapeutic interventions, particularly the education on postpartum mood changes and the introduction of self-regulation techniques, have been beneficial. The patient reported improvement in mood suggests that the strategies discussed have been effective in helping regulate emotions. The patient's decision to discontinue services indicates confidence in maintaining emotional health independently. There are no current assessments indicating risk to self or others.

Plan
The patient is advised to remain vigilant of emotional state and to return to the clinic if the patient feels the need for further services.

The patient presented with sensations of depression linked to being in an abusive relationship. The patient expressed feelings of sadness and distress regarding the treatment by ex-husband. Additionally, the patient sought services to ensure safety and protection. During the session, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) facilitated a WHO intake process, which included connecting with the Family Justice Center. This connection was pivotal in supporting the patient's efforts to obtain a restraining order against ex-husband. The patient reported that the Family Justice Center had successfully assisted the patient in securing this order, contributing to an improved sense of security. Despite these advancements, the patient acknowledged ongoing struggles at times. The BHC introduced the patient ""dropping anchor"" technique, aimed at enhancing focus on the present moment. This approach was part of a broader strategy to help the patient align with values and reinforce safety plan.



Assessment



The patient's progress includes successfully obtaining a restraining order, which has contributed to feeling safer and somewhat alleviated depressive symptoms. However, the patient continues to face challenges, indicating that while there have been gains, the patient's journey towards recovery and stability is ongoing. The patient's engagement with the Family Justice Center and the adoption of mindfulness techniques like ""dropping anchor"" suggest a positive trajectory in managing emotional state and reinforcing personal safety. The BHC noted that the patient has not been reachable for continued WHO services and follow-up, which may impact the patient ongoing progress. Despite this, the patient remains open to returning to the clinic for further support, as indicated by the patient's response to a text message from the BHC.



Plan

She expressed concern regarding her current use of cigarettes as a coping mechanism during pregnancy. She shared that she began smoking at age 16 during her first pregnancy, was able to quit during her second, but has since resumed smoking approximately six cigarettes per day during the early stages of her current pregnancy.

The patient reported feeling unsupported by her partner, particularly in understanding the challenges she faces in trying to quit. She also spoke about experiencing shame, which she identified as a barrier to seeking help or making changes.

We explored the health risks associated with smoking during pregnancy, her mixed feelings about making a committed change, and the role of nicotine addiction, including how tolerance develops over time. We also discussed alternative, healthier coping strategies that could be more supportive of her current goals.

The patient appeared open and motivated to try a new approach.

During the in-person session, the patient presented with a diagnostic impression consistent with major depressive disorder, an anxiety disorder, and an adjustment disorder. The patient reported feeling calm and reflective, noting a slight improvement in mood. However, the patient also described feelings of mild depression, fatigue, stress, and being overwhelmed, particularly in the context of coping with ex-husband's infidelity and abandonment. The patient expressed that the patient is actively working on developing self-care strategies and self-preservation techniques, as well as cultivating greater self-empathy and mindfulness. Challenges in the patient's family life, unemployment, and struggles with daily management, including self-care activities such as eating and sleeping, were also discussed. The patient is exploring ways to secure financial stability and has considered seeking financial services to alleviate the patient's stress. Sleep disturbances were also a topic of concern.

The patient arrived somewhat late for her appointment, dressed casually. Observationally, the patient affect was calm and reflective, showing signs of improvement, yet the patient remained contained, sad, mildly depressed, and fatigued. The patient emotional state appeared fragile, stressed, and sensitive, with moments of feeling emotionally hurt, worry, disappointment, and crying.

Assessment
The patient is currently not reporting any suicidal ideation, and therefore, the patient estimated level of risk to self is considered negligible. The observed and reported symptoms align with the patient diagnosed conditions, indicating a continued need for therapeutic support and intervention.

Plan
The plan for ongoing therapy includes continuing to support the patient in the patient's efforts to cope with the emotional impact of the patient ex-husband's actions and the resultant life changes. Interventions will focus on enhancing the patient's self-care and self-preservation skills, fostering self-empathy, and maintaining mindfulness practices. We will also work on strategies for managing daily life challenges, with an emphasis on improving sleep patterns and addressing financial concerns. The patient will be encouraged to explore financial services that could help reduce the patient's financial stress.

Data
The patient has continued to struggle with depression and suicidal ideations. The patient returned to Clinica Medicos for support and medical assistance. During the Warm Hand Off intake, the patient agreed to begin sessions with a licensed therapist and disclosed experiencing suicidal ideation without any attempts. The patient reported feeling better at present and expressed a desire to discontinue services, while remaining aware of the option to return to the clinic if needed.

Assessment
The patient's ongoing battle with depression and suicidal ideations remains a significant concern. However, there is a noted improvement in the patient's emotional state as the patient currently feels better. The patient awareness of the importance of seeking help if necessary indicates a positive step towards managing the patient's mental health.

The provider expressed caution about introducing more potent medications due to limited familiarity and instead revisited the current counseling plan’s effectiveness. The provider is open to prescribing other medication after consulting with the psychiatrist. When asked to clarify what he expected the medication to address, the patient identified persistent symptoms of depression and anxiety, noting that anxiety remains his primary concern.

He described his current lifestyle as socially withdrawn, largely isolated, and centered around gaming. He is unemployed and acknowledged using these behaviors to cope with emotional distress. Despite this, he expressed interest in finding employment and building social connections, though he admitted feeling unsure about how to pursue these goals. The patient also had a bandage covering the entirety of his left forearm, which he attributed to cutting himself too deep which lead to his visit to the ER. The patient stated that he, however, was not trying to take his own life. 

The patient voiced dissatisfaction with his current counselor and was open to being transferred to a new one. He appears motivated to make changes, despite some resistance from family members, and is taking steps to seek help.

Data
During the session, the patient presented with anxiety, which the patient reported typically intensifies under stress, leading to panic attacks. The patient has been experiencing these symptoms for approximately one month, with a notable exacerbation following the passing of a coworker, resulting in more frequent panic attacks. The patient described physical manifestations of anxiety, such as a sensation of pressure on chest and a lump in throat. The patient noted that these feelings often arise when the patient feels overwhelmed by work and family responsibilities. While the patient was present, children remained in the room, which affected the patient's ability to fully engage in the session. 

Education on anxiety and its symptoms was provided to the patient, and the patient was introduced to techniques such as ""Noticing sensations before panic attacks start,"" ""Dropping Anchor,"" and various breathing exercises aimed at self-regulation. 

The patient reported affective and emotional states included feelings of nervousness, mild anxiety, fearfulness, worry, exhaustion, and stress. Observations revealed the patient as mainly unhappy, sad, mildly depressed, nervous, moderately anxious, panicky, fearful, worried, fatigued, overwhelmed, uncontained, fragile, and distressed. The patient's mental state was characterized by appropriate orientation to person, place, and time, though the patient intellectual functioning was somewhat impaired. 

The primary themes discussed revolved around coping with stress from work and household chores, managing daily life, addressing day-to-day organizational challenges, and focusing on self-care aspects such as eating, sleeping, and finances. The aim was to initiate a plan for improved self-care.


Assessment
The diagnostic impression for the patient is consistent with generalized anxiety disorder and an adjustment disorder. The main therapeutic interventions focused on supportive techniques, emphasizing self-expression and here-and-now functioning, improving problem-solving and coping strategies, evaluating and addressing dysfunctional thoughts, and reviewing and exploring homework assignments. 

The patient expressed relief at being heard and understood, demonstrating openness to the interventions offered. 

Plan
The treatment plan will continue to emphasize supportive techniques and self-expression. There will be a focus on enhancing problem-solving abilities and coping mechanisms, with ongoing evaluation and modification of dysfunctional thoughts. The patient will be encouraged to practice the techniques introduced, such as ""Noticing sensations before panic attacks start"" and ""Dropping Anchor,"" along with breathing exercises for self-regulation. 

Further sessions will explore and reinforce strategies for improved self-care, including better organization, nutrition, sleep hygiene, and financial management. Homework assignments will be reviewed and expanded upon to support these goals.

Data
The patient presented with symptoms of anxiety and depression, reporting sensations of crying, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and persistent negative thoughts. These symptoms have been ongoing for approximately one year and fluctuate in intensity. The onset of emotional struggles is attributed to familial issues. Throughout the treatment process, the patient received education on anxiety and depression. The Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) offered empathetic support as the patient expressed concerns. Tools for self-regulation, such as ""Dropping Anchor,"" breathing exercises, and exploring values in relationships, were introduced to help manage symptoms at home. The patient reported a slight improvement following the initial session and expressed a desire to continue with the services.

Assessment
The patient's symptoms align with clinical presentations of anxiety and depression, likely exacerbated by unresolved family conflicts. The patient reported improvement suggests some responsiveness to the initial interventions. However, the inability to consistently follow up due to communication challenges indicates a need for further engagement strategies. There are no immediate risks to self or others reported.

Plan
To facilitate continuity of care, the BHC will continue to attempt contact through phone calls and text messages, emphasizing the availability of services at the patient's convenience. It is recommended to explore additional communication methods to ensure consistent follow-up. The patient should be encouraged to utilize the self-regulation tools provided and consider setting specific, attainable goals related to managing symptoms. Further sessions should focus on reinforcing these tools and addressing any barriers to their implementation.

The patient exhibits low energy levels and struggles to manage intense sensations of sadness. Importantly, the patient is not reporting any suicide ideation, indicating a negligible current risk to self.

Plan
The ongoing treatment plan will continue with regular sessions to assist the patient in managing the stages of grief in a healthier manner.

Data
The patient presented with symptoms indicative of an adjustment disorder, compounded by depression, anxiety, and relationship difficulties. The patient reported a significant life transition after moving from Mexico to the United States, which has led to a decline in mental health and overall well-being. Previously, the patient enjoyed a fulfilling life with a career, financial independence, family support, and a stable relationship with husband. However, since relocating, the patient has become a stay-at-home mom, experiences feelings of insecurity, lacks personal finances, and faces challenges in relationship with her husband and children.

The patient arrived on time, dressed formally, and reported affective and emotional state included feelings of sadness, moderate depression, anxiety, irritability, worry, fatigue, stress, frustration, resentment, disappointment, and shame. The patient observed emotional state mirrored these reports, with additional notes of embarrassment, discomfort, sensitivity, burnout, guilt, self-reflection, and hopefulness. Mentally, the patient demonstrated appropriate orientation, average intellectual functioning, and strong reflective capacity and insight. The patient global assessment of functioning suggested moderate emotional distress, particularly impacting the patient's relationships, work, and family life.

Data



The student presented with significant challenges following recent life changes. The patient reported that husband was arrested and detained by ICE around the time the patient was hospitalized postpartum. Additionally, the patient experienced a house theft, leading the patient to stay with family for safety. The patient's husband's subsequent deportation added stressors. These events have exacerbated the patient's struggles with depression and anxiety. During the session, the patient expressed feelings of sadness, nervousness, and hopelessness, indicating a desire to focus on managing emotions and practicing self-care during stressful times. The patient shared an interest in learning about depression, life adjustments, and anxiety management techniques. The student was introduced to strategies such as ""Dropping Anchor,"" breathing exercises, and the ""Cup Full"" method to help the patient notice and make space for uncomfortable feelings rather than accepting them passively.



Assessment



The student's current emotional state reflects significant distress due to the accumulation of traumatic events, including husband's deportation and personal losses. The patient is actively experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety, as evidenced by the patient reported feelings of hopelessness and nervousness. Despite the patient's willingness to engage in strategies to manage these emotions, the patient attendance at follow-up appointments has lapsed, and the patient has not been reachable for further contact. This suggests potential barriers to accessing ongoing support, which may exacerbate the patient mental health challenges if left unaddressed.



Plan



To support the patient, it is recommended to continue offering educational resources on managing depression, anxiety, and life transitions. Emphasizing the importance of self-care practices and providing tools for emotional regulation remains crucial. Efforts should be made to reconnect with the patient, as previous attempts to schedule follow-up appointments via phone have been unsuccessful. A final message was sent, encouraging the patient to return to the clinic if feels the need for services. It is essential to explore alternative methods of communication or support that might facilitate the patient engagement in ongoing care. Additionally, considering the patient's current living situation, referrals to community resources that can offer stability and support during this tumultuous period may be beneficial.

Data
The patient presented with struggles related to anxiety, specifically triggered by a distressing family incident involving the patient's brother and mother in home country. The patient expressed significant fear that brother and mother might endure similar experiences again. The patient reported experiencing panic attacks, which have been exacerbated by attempts to ignore these uncomfortable feelings. During the session, the focus was placed on educating the patient about anxiety and the importance of acknowledging rather than ignoring uncomfortable emotions. The patient's family holds considerable importance to the patient, and the patient expressed a strong desire to ensure their well-being. Techniques such as ""Dropping Anchor"" and breathing exercises were introduced to the patient as self-regulation strategies.

Assessment
The patient's anxiety appears to be significantly influenced by familial concerns, particularly regarding brother and mother. Despite attempts to manage anxiety by ignoring the patient's uncomfortable feelings, this approach has worsened physical symptoms. The patient has demonstrated an understanding of the importance of family's well-being, which aligns with patient's values. There has been no progress towards the treatment goals, which aim for the patient to manage the anxiety in healthier ways.

Plan
To support the patient in achieving treatment goals, it is recommended to continue reinforcing the techniques taught, such as ""Dropping Anchor"" and breathing exercises, to help the patient better manage anxiety. Additionally, efforts should be made to re-establish contact with the patient, as there have been challenges in reaching the patient via phone calls and text messages. Further sessions should focus on strengthening the patient's ability to notice and address uncomfortable feelings effectively, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the capacity to manage anxiety in a healthier manner.
