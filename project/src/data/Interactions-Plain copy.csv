Assessment



The patient's current emotional and psychological state is characterized by a complex interplay of depressive and anxiety symptoms, likely exacerbated by recent life events such as a car accident and an unexpected pregnancy. These experiences appear to be contributing to the patient's feelings of stress, anxiety, and pressure. The patient's ability to maintain orientation and average intellectual functioning suggests a capacity for insight and engagement in therapeutic processes, despite the patient's current challenges. The diagnostic impressions align with her reported experiences and observed emotional states, indicating a need for continued therapeutic intervention focused on coping mechanisms and emotional support.



Plan



The treatment plan will involve continued weekly sessions, scheduled every 2-4 weeks, to monitor the patient's emotional state and provide ongoing support. The focus will remain on helping the patient manage stress resulting from recent life changes and developing effective coping strategies. Therapeutic interventions will continue to emphasize supportive techniques, fostering self-expression, addressing here-and-now functioning, and enhancing problem-solving and coping skills.

He reported to both the medical and behavioral health teams that his current medication regimen, including a maxed-out dose of sertraline, has not been effective.

The provider expressed caution about introducing more potent medications due to limited familiarity and instead revisited the current counseling plan’s effectiveness. The provider is open to prescribing other medication after consulting with the psychiatrist. When asked to clarify what he expected the medication to address, the patient identified persistent symptoms of depression and anxiety, noting that anxiety remains his primary concern.

He described his current lifestyle as socially withdrawn, largely isolated, and centered around gaming. He is unemployed and acknowledged using these behaviors to cope with emotional distress. Despite this, he expressed interest in finding employment and building social connections, though he admitted feeling unsure about how to pursue these goals. The patient also had a bandage covering the entirety of his left forearm, which he attributed to cutting himself too deep which lead to his visit to the ER. The patient stated that he, however, was not trying to take his own life. 

The patient voiced dissatisfaction with his current counselor and was open to being transferred to a new one. He appears motivated to make changes, despite some resistance from family members, and is taking steps to seek help.

2nd call attempt, TERMINATION:

Data
The patient presented with struggles related to anxiety, specifically triggered by a distressing family incident involving the patient's brother and mother in home country. The patient expressed significant fear that brother and mother might endure similar experiences again. The patient reported experiencing panic attacks, which have been exacerbated by attempts to ignore these uncomfortable feelings. During the session, the focus was placed on educating the patient about anxiety and the importance of acknowledging rather than ignoring uncomfortable emotions. The patient's family holds considerable importance to the patient, and the patient expressed a strong desire to ensure their well-being. Techniques such as ""Dropping Anchor"" and breathing exercises were introduced to the patient as self-regulation strategies.

Assessment
The patient's anxiety appears to be significantly influenced by familial concerns, particularly regarding brother and mother. Despite attempts to manage anxiety by ignoring the patient's uncomfortable feelings, this approach has worsened physical symptoms. The patient has demonstrated an understanding of the importance of family's well-being, which aligns with patient's values. There has been no progress towards the treatment goals, which aim for the patient to manage the anxiety in healthier ways.

Plan
To support the patient in achieving treatment goals, it is recommended to continue reinforcing the techniques taught, such as ""Dropping Anchor"" and breathing exercises, to help the patient better manage anxiety. Additionally, efforts should be made to re-establish contact with the patient, as there have been challenges in reaching the patient via phone calls and text messages. Further sessions should focus on strengthening the patient's ability to notice and address uncomfortable feelings effectively, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the capacity to manage anxiety in a healthier manner. Continued emphasis on the patient's values and the importance of patient's family may provide motivation and context for the patient therapeutic progress."

Patient presented to the office following her initial appointment with Nurse John. She shared a difficult personal history that includes her alcoholic father being abusive before his death three years ago. She noted that her mother never left the father despite the abuse, and described her as emotionally unavailable throughout her childhood. She also reported a history of sexual abuse by her stepfather. The patient has moved frequently and immigrated to the U.S. at a young age, which disrupted her sense of stability.

She disclosed two prior suicide attempts during particularly overwhelming times—one three years ago involving cutting her wrists and another a month ago involving a hanging attempt. She described her daily routine as repetitive and unchanging: waking up, eating, and sleeping with no real variation or engagement in other activities. She expressed feeling unmotivated and stated that she doesn't have any goals at the moment.

The patient mentioned experiencing unsettling perceptual experiences, such as hearing voices when her mother isn’t around and seeing shadowy figures in her peripheral vision—especially eyes or a red, eerie face. These experiences seemed to cause her discomfort but were shared without panic or disorganization.

O: Objective
The patient was quiet and reserved during the session but engaged appropriately. Affect was flat but appropriate to the content shared. She showed insight into her challenges and communicated clearly despite the emotional weight of the topics. She appeared somewhat guarded at first but gradually opened up. By the end of the session, the patient appeared more at ease and even expressed a sense of relief after being heard and supported by the Behavioral Health (BH) team. She remained open to trying new things, and getting outside her comfort zone, like following up with the counseling team and learning more tools to handle her situation.

A: Assessment
Patient is a 14-year-old adolescent navigating a history of significant family trauma, instability, and emotional neglect. Her responses suggest she is carrying a great deal for her age, with limited tools or support systems to help her cope. Her experiences—both internal and external—appear to be overwhelming and may be contributing to feelings of hopelessness, isolation, and emotional exhaustion. The perceptual disturbances she described may be related to the stress and trauma she’s endured.

She appears to be in need of consistent emotional support, safety, and guidance to help her begin building a healthier internal narrative and future goals.

P: Plan

Provided support and helped normalize the complex emotions and reactions she is experiencing given her background.

Reinforced the BH office as a safe and judgment-free space she can return to whenever she needs support.

Referral initiated for counseling to help her start developing coping tools, explore her experiences more deeply, and build resilience over time.

Provided information about the Family Justice Center for additional resources and support related to her past experiences and current needs.

Encouraged ongoing engagement with the BH team and emphasized that seeking help is a strength, not a weakness., The BH team called the patient's guardian to assess progress.

Data
The patient presented with symptoms of anxiety and depression, reporting sensations of crying, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and persistent negative thoughts. These symptoms have been ongoing for approximately one year and fluctuate in intensity. The onset of emotional struggles is attributed to familial issues. Throughout the treatment process, the patient received education on anxiety and depression. The Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) offered empathetic support as the patient expressed concerns. Tools for self-regulation, such as ""Dropping Anchor,"" breathing exercises, and exploring values in relationships, were introduced to help manage symptoms at home. The patient reported a slight improvement following the initial session and expressed a desire to continue with the services.

Assessment
The patient's symptoms align with clinical presentations of anxiety and depression, likely exacerbated by unresolved family conflicts. The patient reported improvement suggests some responsiveness to the initial interventions. However, the inability to consistently follow up due to communication challenges indicates a need for further engagement strategies. There are no immediate risks to self or others reported.

Plan
To facilitate continuity of care, the BHC will continue to attempt contact through phone calls and text messages, emphasizing the availability of services at the patient's convenience. It is recommended to explore additional communication methods to ensure consistent follow-up. The patient should be encouraged to utilize the self-regulation tools provided and consider setting specific, attainable goals related to managing symptoms. Further sessions should focus on reinforcing these tools and addressing any barriers to their implementation. If the patient returns, reassessment of goals and objectives will be necessary to track progress and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.

Data
The patient presented with significant anxiety and worry following the news of an unexpected pregnancy. The patient expressed concerns about family's reaction and whether the father of the baby would remain involved. The patient reported experiencing persistent, intrusive thoughts regarding these issues, which have been contributing to the distress. During the session, the patient appeared visibly anxious, with observed signs such as fidgeting and avoidance of eye contact, which align with the patient reported emotional state. The patient's biopsychosocial context includes potential familial pressures and the stress of managing a new, unplanned life event. The treatment plan initially focused on helping the patient's process these emotions and thoughts, alongside providing information about community support programs for mothers. However, the patient has not yet engaged with these resources.


Assessment
The patient's primary issue involves anxiety related to unexpected pregnancy and concerns about familial and paternal reactions. The patient reported intrusive thoughts are indicative of heightened anxiety levels, which are impacting the patient ability to cope effectively. The lack of engagement with recommended support programs and the inability to maintain consistent communication suggest potential barriers to accessing care, which may be due to logistical challenges or emotional overwhelm. There is no immediate risk to self or others reported in this session. The unmet goals and objectives highlight the need for ongoing support and possibly alternative strategies to facilitate engagement with mental health services.


Plan
To address the patient's current needs, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) will continue efforts to establish contact, recognizing the challenges posed by the patient's unresponsive contact number. It is crucial to explore alternative communication methods or support systems that might assist in reconnecting with the patient. If the patient returns to the clinic, the BHC will prioritize revisiting anxiety management strategies and reinforcing the importance of community support programs. Additionally, exploring potential barriers to the patient's engagement with these resources will be essential. The BHC will also assess the feasibility of involving family members or other support networks to provide with additional emotional backing. Continued attempts to engage the patient in treatment are medically necessary to ensure the patient receives the support needed to navigate current challenges effectively."

The provision of the 988 crisis number was an important step in ensuring she has immediate access to help if needed.

Plan
Moving forward, the patient has agreed to explore counseling options at the patient's school. The patient mother will assist in this process by inquiring about available school counseling services. Should school-based counseling not be an option, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) will facilitate a connection with a child counselor in the community. The plan emphasizes the importance of continued therapeutic support to address the patient's mental health needs and to provide the patient with strategies to manage the patient emotions and family-related challenges., TERMINATION:

During the behavioral health consultation, the patient and her mother discussed two primary reasons for behavioral distress: The physical health of the youngest child in the family and a traumatic incident that happened two years ago. The mother and sister spoke about their anxieties regarding the youngest, who has hydrocephaly, amongst other health concerns, which they both stated caused uncertainty and stress in the family. The traumatic incident involved an individual under the influence almost running over the youngest some time ago, causing an altercation between the man and the father, causing the individual to point a firearm at the father's head. The patient cites this traumatic event as the main reason for her insomnia and unwanted thoughts. The patient's mother has constant anxiety about losing her child at any time yet chooses to remain hopeful. The consultation focused on the futility of wanting to control our unwanted memories and information regarding cycles of rumination. Dropping anchor and breathing exercises were deployed to help minimize stress and take goal-oriented action despite unwanted memories. The patient will continue to follow up with their therapist at the Kennedy Center. The guardian will call the clinic if they require additional help.  

Consultation with TG: 
The provider mentioned that spending time outdoors, particularly in places like Highland Park, could offer emotional relief and support the patient's mental well-being. The patient should be encouraged to incorporate nature into their routine.

During the behavioral health consultation, the patient disclosed that his onset of Ed was during his first sexual experience at 17, causing shame, performance anxiety, and a lack of self-confidence. He disclosed having fear and avoidance of sex for the next 5 years and not having a partner during that time. He most recently began having sexual intercourse, having five partners since the time of the present visit, with one of them cheating on him, which he thinks was in part due to his sexual impotence. During the present visit, we reflected on the shame he feels every time he has sex and how it may feed his insecurities regarding sex, as well as the importance of building sexual tension and foreplay. We also discussed the importance of using sexual protection and exploring things like using condoms or trying novel sexual experiences with his supportive partner to build confidence and minimize shame over time. The patient proved eager to try these approaches and to frameshift sex as an experience filled with trial and error that, with more practice and less shame, can turn into a fun bonding experience between supportive partners. The team will follow up with the patient in two weeks to assess progress. 

Consult with TG: The physician discussed the potential connection between sudden onset erectile dysfunction (ED) and underlying vascular conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

Key Points:
Vascular Disease: In men under 40, ED can sometimes be an early sign of vascular problems, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which can affect blood flow to the penis.

Sudden Onset: A sudden appearance of ED might suggest an underlying issue, such as vascular disease, which could be present even in younger, otherwise healthy individuals.

Psychological Factors: While physical causes like vascular disease are significant, psychological factors like stress or anxiety can also contribute to ED. Resources like Come as You Are by Emily Nagoski were mentioned to address the psychological aspects of ED and encourage a holistic approach to treatment.

Data



Patient presented initially for services due to experiencing symptoms consistent with post-partum depression. Despite efforts to engage the patient in treatment, the patient has not been responsive to attempts to schedule appointments. The Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) made numerous attempts to contact via phone to arrange a Warm Hand Off (WHO) appointment but was unsuccessful. As a result, there have been no gains or progress made in treatment. The patient goals and objectives remain unattained due to this lack of communication and engagement.



Assessment



The patient's lack of response to outreach efforts suggests a potential disengagement from the therapeutic process. This may be indicative of ongoing struggles with post-partum depression symptoms, which could be affecting motivation or ability to participate in scheduled sessions. The absence of observable emotional states or reported feelings during these interactions further complicates the understanding of current mental health status. There is no evidence to suggest an immediate risk to self or others based on the available data.



Plan



The BHC will attempt one final phone call to reach the patient, emphasizing the availability of services should decide to return to the clinic. A voicemail was left, indicating that the patient may return to the clinic when ready to engage with services. If contact is re-established, a comprehensive reassessment of the patient's mental health status and current needs will be necessary to adjust treatment goals and objectives accordingly. Additionally, exploring alternative methods of communication or support, such as email or text messaging, might be considered to enhance accessibility and engagement."

During the in-person session, the patient presented with a diagnostic impression consistent with generalized anxiety disorder. Mother expressed a pervasive fear of potential harm in various aspects of the patient's life. Subjectively, the patient's mother reported feeling mildly anxious, fragile, nervous, quiet, and scared. The focus of the discussion revolved around strategies for managing and coping with daily life challenges and exploring social resources to enhance his life situation.

Objectively, the patient was punctual, and attire was appropriate for the session. His affective and emotional state was observed as embarrassed, uncomfortable, fragile, shy, and nervous. Throughout the session, therapeutic interventions were employed, including supportive techniques, emphasizing present functioning, and providing empathy and emotional support. Attuned listening to the patient's immediate emotional experience was also a key component of the session. The patient demonstrated an openness to the services offered to alleviate the patient's life stressors.

Assessment
The patient did not report any suicidal ideation, indicating that his current level of risk to himself is negligible. The therapeutic interventions facilitated an environment where the patient felt supported and understood, which allowed the patient to engage with the therapeutic process positively.


Plan
Moving forward, the plan includes providing the patient and the patient's mother with self-regulation tools, such as the 5,4,3,2,1 grounding technique and breathing exercises, to help manage the patient's anxiety symptoms. The patient's mother has expressed interest in pursuing counseling for the patient. Accordingly, a referral to Volunteer Behavior Health will be made to secure additional support and counseling services for the patient., BHC called Volunteer Behavior Health to comfrim if patient may receive counsleing services with them. Front desk stated yes along with the patient's insurnace. 

BHC tried to contact mother and father to provide Volunteer Behavioral Health number and info how to reach out to them. Both numbers are out of order., TERMINATION:

Data
The patient presented with significant anxiety, manifesting as chest pain and crying spells. The patient's mother reported that these symptoms had been troubling the patient for approximately two years. During the session, the patient expressed feelings of overwhelming anxiety, which were observed as described physical sensations of tightness and shortness of breath. The patient also reported episodes of unexplained crying.
Efforts were made to provide the patient and the patient's mother with self-regulation tools aimed at managing symptoms, particularly during episodes of chest pain. However, despite these efforts, there was no observed progress in the patient's ability to manage symptoms independently. The inability to connect with the patient's family further hindered the provision of ongoing support, as the referral to the Volunteer Behavioral Health Center could not be completed due to disconnected contact numbers.

Assessment
The patient's ongoing anxiety appears to be significantly impacting daily functioning, particularly in relation to school and social environments. The lack of progress in symptom management suggests a need for a more structured intervention, possibly involving a specialist in pediatric anxiety. The patient's emotional state, characterized by frequent crying spells and physical manifestations of anxiety, indicates a high level of distress that requires immediate attention. The inability to reach family for further support underscores the urgency of finding alternative means to ensure continuity of care.

Plan
Given the current situation, it is recommended that the patient and family are encouraged to seek services from another behavioral health provider who can offer more consistent support. Behavioral Health Consultant has tried to connect with the patient's mother to provide services but has no been able to connect with family due to numbers are disconnected. , Per Heidi request the patient is interested in BH services due to the patient continues to struggle with grief. BHC called the patient to follow up and offer services. Patient stated that he travels and has found a counselor that can help him from a family member.

Data
During the in-person session, the patient presented with a diagnostic impression consistent with major depressive disorder, an anxiety disorder, an adjustment disorder, and suicidal thoughts/attempt. The patient reported feeling sad, distressed, mildly anxious, worried, and stressed, with sensations of crying, feeling down, and disappointment. The patient inability to sleep was also noted. The session focused on coping with frustrations, conflict with family member, a recent separation from partner, and the betrayal of ex-boyfriend cheating with the patient's sister. We also discussed difficulties with managing anger and distress within family, transitioning to adulthood and adult responsibilities, the strain of mid-life transitions, coping with recent changes in family life, and dealing with the news of an unexpected pregnancy and considering abortion options.

Upon observation, the patient appeared on time for the appointment, was appropriately dressed, and presented with an affective and emotional state that was mainly unhappy, sad, distressed, moderately depressed, withdrawn, moderately anxious, angry, fearful, fragile, shy, stressed, resentful, sensitive, emotionally hurt, worried, frustrated, embarrassed, and crying. Notably, the patient also expressed feelings of disappointment, anger, and suicidal ideation.

The therapeutic interventions utilized during the session included supportive techniques, fostering self-expression, focusing on here-and-now functioning, coping with current life difficulties, providing empathy and emotional support, and attuned listening to immediate emotional experiences. The patient's response to these interventions was indicative of high level of distress and the need for ongoing support and crisis management.

Assessment
The patient's reported suicidal ideation, intention, and risk factors, coupled with her lack of protective factors, indicate a high and significant level of imminent risk to self. The emotional and psychological turmoil the patient is experiencing due to relational issues, recent separation, and unexpected pregnancy contribute to heightened risk status. Patient mentioned not wanting to hurt mother is the motivation to not hurt self. Patient mentioned only having suicidal ideation with no attempt as on now. 

Plan
Given the patient's high level of risk to self, the patient has been referred to Clinica Renuevo to begin sessions with a therapist specialized in managing such crises. Behavioral Health Consultation (BHC) will continue WHO sessions to assist the patient in managing the new changes in life, including the recent betrayal by ex-partner with her sister and the news of unexpected pregnancy. Additionally, BHC will provide the patient with resources to help reduce worry and stress regarding the unexpected pregnancy, ensuring the patient has access to the necessary support during this challenging period., BHC called the patient to follow up on how she was doing form the first intake last week.

This is the second attempt., TERMINATION:
Background
The patient initially presented with symptoms of depression accompanied by suicidal ideations, further compounded by the unexpected news of pregnancy. The patient expressed significant distress over this development, as the patient had not planned to become pregnant in the near future. During the initial consultation, the patient sought information and resources regarding abortion or adoption options. Additionally, the patient was grappling with feelings of betrayal stemming from recent breakup with an ex-boyfriend and perceived betrayal by the patient's sister.

Treatment Summary
Throughout the treatment process, the Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC) focused on educating the patient about depression, aiming to help the patient understand condition better. The BHC encouraged the patient to express and process the myriad of emotions the patient was experiencing. The therapeutic approach centered on continuing sessions to equip with tools and knowledge necessary for healing from recent breakup and exploring potential solutions regarding unexpected pregnancy. However, there have been no significant gains or progress noted thus far, and the initial goals and objectives remain unattained.


Recommendations
Despite efforts to maintain contact, the BHC has faced challenges in reaching the patient since the initial intake. According to Jasmin, the patient has relocated out of state. The BHC made one final attempt to reach the patient and suggested that if the patient might consider returning to Clinica Medicos for further support., BHC called the patient to follow up on how she is doing and if is in need or BH services or social services.
